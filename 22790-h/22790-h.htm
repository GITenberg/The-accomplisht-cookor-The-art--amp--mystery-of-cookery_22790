To the Master Cooks, and to such young Practitioners of the Art of
Cookery, to whom this Book may be useful.</h5>

<p><span class = "firstletter">T</span>O you first, most worthy Artists,
I acknowledg one of the chief Motives that made me to adventure this
Volume to your Censures, hath been to testifie my gratitude to your
experienced Society; nor could I omit to direct it to you, as it hath
been my ambition, that you should be sensible of my Proficiency of
Endeavours in this Art. To all honest well intending Men of our
Profession, or others, this Book cannot but be acceptable, as it plainly
and profitably discovers the <i>Mystery</i> of the <i>whole Art</i>; for
which, though I may be <i>envied by some that only value their private
Interests above Posterity, and the publick good</i>, yet God and my own
Conscience would not permit me <i>to bury these my Experiences with my
Silver Hairs in the Grave</i>: and that more especially, as the
advantages of my Education hath raised me above the <i>Ambitions</i> of
others, in the converse I have had with other <i>Nations</i>, who in
this <i>Art</i> fall short of what I <i>have known experimented by you
my worthy Country men</i>. Howsoever, the <i>French by their
Insinuations, not without enough of Ignorance</i>, have bewitcht some of
the <i>Gallants of our Nation</i> with Epigram Dishes, smoakt rather
than drest, so strangely to captivate the <i>Gusto</i>, their
<i>Mushroom’d Experiences</i> for <i>Sauce</i> rather than <i>Diet</i>,
for the generality howsoever called <i>A-la-mode</i>, not worthy of
being taken notice on. As I live in <i>France</i>, and had the Language
and have been an eye-witness of their <i>Cookeries</i> as well, as a
Peruser of their Manuscripts, and Printed <i>Authors</i> whatsoever I
found good in them, I&nbsp;have inserted in this <i>Volume</i>.
I&nbsp;do acknowledg my self not to be a little
<span class = "folionum added">A4v</span>
<!-- png005 -->
beholding to the <i>Italian</i> and <i>Spanish</i> Treatises; though
without my fosterage, and bringing up under the <i>Generosities</i> and
<i>Bounties of my Noble Patrons and Masters</i>, I&nbsp;could never have
arrived to this <i>Experience</i>. To be confined and limited to the
narrowness of a Purse, is to want the <i>Materials</i> from which the
<i>Artist</i> must gain his knowledge. Those <i>Honourable Persons</i>,
<i>my Lord</i> Lumley, and others, with whom I have spent a part of my
time, were such whose generous cost never weighed the Expence, so that
they might arrive to that right and high esteem they had of their
<i>Gusto’s</i>. Whosoever peruses this <i>Volume</i> shall find it amply
exemplified in <i>Dishes</i> of such high prices, which only these
<i>Noblesses Hospitalities</i> did reach to: I&nbsp;should have sinned
against their (to be perpetuated) Bounties, if I had not set down their
several varieties, that the <i>Reader</i> might be as well acquainted
with what is extraordinary, as what is ordinary in this <i>Art</i>; as I
am truly sensible, that some of those things that I have set down will
amaze a not thorow-paced <i>Reader</i> in the <i>Art of Cookery</i>, as
they are Delicates, never till this time made known to the World.</p>

<p><i>Fellow Cooks</i>, that I might give a testimony to my
<i>Countrey</i> of the <i>laudableness of our Profession</i>, that I
might encourage young Undertakers to make a Progress in the <i>Practice
of this Art</i>, I&nbsp;have laid open these Experiences, as I was most
unwilling to hide my Talent, but have ever endeavoured to do good to
others; I&nbsp;acknowledge that there hath already been <i>several Books
publisht</i>, and amongst the rest some out of the <i>French</i>, for
ought I could perceive to very little purpose, <i>empty and unprofitable
Treatises</i>, of as little use as some <i>Niggards Kitchens</i>, which
the <i>Reader</i> in respect of the confusion of the Method, or
barrenness of those <i>Authors</i> experience, hath rather been puzled
then profited by; as those already
<span class = "folionum added">A5</span>
<!-- png006 -->
extant Authors have trac’t but one common beaten Road, repeating for the
main what others have in the same homely manner done before them: It
hath been my task to denote some <i>new Faculty or Science</i>, that
others have not yet discovered; this the <i>Reader</i> will quickly
discern by those <i>new Terms of Art</i> which he shall meet withal
throughout this <i>whole Volume</i>. Some things I have inserted of
<i>Carving and Sewing</i> that I might demonstrate the whole Art. In the
contrivance of these my labours, I&nbsp;have so managed them for the
general good, that those whose Purses cannot reach to the cost of rich
Dishes, I&nbsp;have descended to their meaner Expences, that they may
give, though upon a sudden Treatment, to their Kindred, Friends, Allies
and Acquaintance, a&nbsp;handsome and relishing entertainment in all
seasons of the year, though at some distance from Towns or Villages. Nor
have my serious considerations been wanting amongst direction for Diet
how to order what belongs to the sick, as well as to those that are in
health; and withal my care hath been such, that in this Book as in a
Closet, is contained all such Secrets as relate to <i>Preserving</i>,
<i>Conserving</i>, <i>Candying</i>, <i>Distilling</i>, and such rare
varieties as they are most concern’d in the <i>best husbandring and
huswifering</i> of them. Nor is there any Book except that of the
<i>Queens Closet</i>, which was so <i>enricht with Receipts</i>
presented to her <i>Majesty</i>, as yet that I ever saw in any
<i>Language</i>, that ever contained so many <i>profitable Experiences,
as in this Volume</i>: in all which the <i>Reader</i> shall find most of
the <i>Compositions</i>, and mixtures easie to be prepared, most
pleasing to the Palate, and not too chargeable to the Purse; since you
are at liberty to employ as much or as little therein as you please.</p>

<p>In this Edition I have enlarged the whole Work; and
<span class = "folionum added">A5v</span>
<!-- png007 -->
there is added two hundred several Figures of all sorts of Pies, Tarts,
Custards, Cheesecakes, &amp;c. more than was in the former: You will
find them in Tables directed to the <i>Folio</i> they have relation to;
there being such variety of Forms, the Artists may use which of them
they please.</p>

<p>It is impossible for any <i>Author</i> to please all People, no more
than the best Cook can fancy their Palats whose Mouths are always out of
taste. As for those who make it their business to hide their Candle
under a Bushel, to do only good to themselves, and not to others, such
as will curse me for revealing the Secrets of this Art, I&nbsp;value the
discharge of my own Conscience, in doing Good, above all their malice;
protesting to the whole world, that I have not <i>concealed any material
Secret</i> of above my <i>fifty and five years Experience</i>; my Father
<i>being a Cook</i> under whom in my Child-hood I was bred up in this
Art.</p>

<p>To conclude, the diligent Peruser of this <i>Volume</i> gains that in
a small time (as to the <i>Theory</i>) which an <i>Apprenticeship</i>
with some <i>Masters</i> could never have taught them. I&nbsp;have no
more to do, but to desire of God a blessing upon these my Endeavours;
and remain.</p>

<h5><a name = "life" id = "life">
A short Narrative of some Passages of the Authors Life.</a></h5>

<p><span class = "firstletter">F</span>OR the better knowledge of the
worth of this Book, though it be not usual, the <i>Author</i> being
living, it will not be amiss to acquaint the <i>Reader</i> with a breif
account of some passages of his Life, as also the eminent Persons
(renowned for their House-keeping) whom he hath served through the whole
series of his Life; for as the growth of Children argue the strength of
the Parents, so doth the judgment and abilities of the Artist conduce to
the making and goodness of the Work: now that such great knowledge in
this commendable Art was not gained but by long experience, practise,
and converse with the most able men in their times, the <i>Reader</i> in
this breif Narrative may be informed by what steps and degrees he
ascended to the same.</p>

<p>He was born in the year of our Lord 1588. His Father being one of the
ablest <i>Cooks</i> in his time, and his first Tutor in the knowledge
and practice of Cookery; under whom having attained to some perfection
in this Art, the old Lady <i>Dormer</i> sent him over into
<i>France</i>, where he continued five years, being in the Family of a
noble Peer, and first President of <i>Paris</i>; where he gained not
only the <i>French</i> Tongue but also bettered his Knowledge in his
<i>Cookery</i>, and returning again into <i>England</i>, was bound an
Apprentice in <i>London</i> to Mr. <i>Arthur Hollinsworth</i> in
<i>Newgate Market</i>, one of the ablest Work-men in <i>London</i>, Cook
to the <i>Grocers Hall and Star Chamber</i>. His Apprentiship being out,
the Lady <i>Dormer</i> sent for him to be her Cook under
<span class = "folionum added">A6v</span>
<!-- png009 -->
Father (who then served that Honourable Lady) where were four Cooks
more, such Noble Houses were then kept, the glory of that, and the shame
of this present Age; then were those Golden Days wherein were practised
the <i>Triumphs and Trophies of Cookery</i>; then was Hospitality
esteemed, Neighbourhood preserved, the Poor cherished, and God honoured;
then was Religion less talkt on, and more practised; then was Atheism
&amp; Schism less in fashion: then did men strive to be good, rather
then to seem so. Here he continued till the Lady <i>Dormer</i> died, and
then went again to <i>London</i>, and served the Lord
<i>Castlehaven</i>, after that the Lord <i>Lumley</i>, that great lover
and knower of Art, who wanted no knowledge in the discerning this
mystery; next the Lord <i>Montague</i> in <i>Sussex</i>; and at the
beginning of these wars, the Countess of <i>Kent</i>, then Mr.
<i>Nevel</i> of <i>Crissen Temple</i> in <i>Essex</i>, whose Ancestors
the <i>Smiths</i> (of whom he is descended) were the greatest
maintainers of Hospitality in all those parts; nor doth the present
M.&nbsp;<i>Nevel</i> degenerate from their laudable examples. Divers
other Persons of like esteem and quality hath he served; as the Lord
<i>Rivers</i>, Mr. <i>John Ashburnam</i> of the Bed-Chambers, Dr.
<i>Steed</i> in <i> Kent</i>, Sir <i>Thomas Stiles</i> of <i>Drury
Lane</i> in <i>London</i>, Sir <i>Marmaduke Constable</i> in
<i>York-shire</i>, Sir <i>Charles Lucas</i>; and lastly the Right
Honourable the Lady <i>Englefield</i>, where he now liveth.</p>

<p>Thus have I given you a breif account of his Life, I&nbsp;shall next
tell you in what high esteem this noble Art was with the Ancient Romans:
<i>Plutarch</i> reports, that <i>Lucullus</i> his ordinary diet was fine
dainty dishes, with works of pastry, banketting dishes, and fruit
curiously wrought and prepared; that, his Table might be furnished with
choice of varieties, (as the noble Lord <i>Lumley</i> did) that he kept
and nourished all manner
<span class = "folionum added">A7</span>
<!-- png010 -->
of Fowl all the year long. To this purpose he telleth us a story how
<i>Pompey</i> being sick, the Physitians willed him to eat a Thrush, and
it being said there was none to be had; because it was then Summer; it
was answered they might have them at <i>Lucullus</i>’s house who kept
both Thrushes and all manner of Fowl, all the year long. This
<i>Lucullus</i> was for his Hospitality so esteemed in <i>Rome</i>, that
there was no talk, but of his Noble House-keeping. The said
<i>Plutarch</i> reports how <i>Cicero</i> and <i>Pompey</i> inviting
themselves to sup with him<ins class = "punct" title = ". for ,">,&nbsp;</ins>they would not let him speak with his men to provide any
thing more then ordinary; but he telling them he would sup in
<i>Apollo</i>, (a&nbsp;Chamber so named, and every Chamber proportioned
their expences) he by this wile beguil’d them, and a supper was made
ready estimated at fifty thousand pence, every <i>Roman</i> penny being
seven pence half penny <i>English</i> money; a&nbsp;vast sum for that
Age, before the <i>Indies</i> had overflowed <i>Europe</i>. But I have
too far digressed from the Author of whom I might speak much more as in
relation to his Person and abilities, but who will cry out the Sun
shines? this already said is enough to satisfie any but the malicious,
who are the greatest enemies to all honest endeavours. <i>Homer</i> had
his <i>Zoilus</i>, and <i>Virgil</i> his <i>Bavius</i>; the best Wits
have had their detractors, and the greatest Artists have been maligned;
the best on’t is, such Works as these outlive their <i>Authors</i> with
an honurable respect of Posterity, whilst envious Criticks never survive
their own happiness, their Lives going out like the snuff of a
Candle.</p>

in places convenient as you see them in Ships of war, with such holes
and trains of powder that they may all take Fire; Place your Ship firm
in the great Charger; then make a salt round about it, and stick therein
egg-shells full of sweet water, you may by a great Pin take all the meat
out of the egg by blowing, and then fill it up with the rose-water, then
in another Charger have the proportion of a Stag made of course paste,
with a broad Arrow in the side of him, and his body filled up with
claret-wine; in another Charger at the end of the Stag have the
proportion of a Castle with Battlements, Portcullices, Gates and
Draw-Bridges made of Past-board, the Guns and Kickses, and covered with
course paste as the former; place it at a distance from the ship to fire
at each other. The Stag being placed betwixt them with egg shells full
of sweet water (as before) placed in salt. At each side of the Charger
wherein is the Stag, place a Pye made of course paste, in one of which
let there be some live Frogs, in each other some live Birds; make these
Pyes of course Paste filled with bran, and yellowed over with saffron or
the yolks of eggs, guild them over in spots, as also the Stag, the Ship,

Frogs, and Birds, and close up the holes with the same course paste,
then cut the Lids neatly up; To be taken off the Tunnels; being all
placed in order upon the Table, before you fire the trains of powder,
order it so that some of the Ladies may be perswaded to pluck the Arrow
out of the Stag, then will the Claret-wine follow, as blood that runneth
out of a wound. This being done with admiration to the beholders, after
some short pause, fire the train of the Castle, that the pieces all of
one side may go off, then fire the Trains, of one side of the Ship as in
a battel; next turn the Chargers; and by degrees fire the trains of each
other side as before. This done to sweeten the stink of powder, let the
Ladies take the egg-shells full of sweet waters and throw them at each
other. All dangers being seemingly over, by this time you may suppose
they will desire to see what is in the pyes; where lifting first the lid
off one pye, out skip some Frogs, which make the Ladies to skip and
shreek; next after the other pye, whence come out the Birds, who by a
natural instinct flying in the light, will put out the Candles; so that
what with the flying Birds and skipping Frogs, the one above, the other
beneath, will cause much delight and pleasure to the whole company: at
length the Candles are lighted, and a banquet brought in, the Musick
sounds, and every one with much delight and content rehearses their
actions in the former passages. These were formerly the delight of the
Nobility, before good House-keeping had left <i>England</i>, and the
Sword really acted that which was only counterfeited in such honest and
laudable Exercises as these.</p>

Directions for the order of<br>
carving Fowl.</a></h3>


<h5>Lift that Swan.</h5>

<p>The manner of cutting up a Swan must be to slit her right down in the
middle of the breast, and so clean thorow the back from the neck to the
rump, so part her in two halves cleanly and handsomly, that you break
not nor tear the meat, lay the two halves in a fair charger with the
slit sides downwards, throw salt about it, and let it again on the
Table. Let your sauce be chaldron for a Swan, and serve it in
saucers.</p>


<h5>Rear the Goose.</h5>

<p>You must break a goose contrary to the former way.
<span class = "folionum">B3</span>
<!-- png018 -->
Take a goose<a class = "tag" name = "tagA" id = "tagA" href =
"#noteA">A</a> being roasted, and take off both his legs fair like a
shoulder of Lamb, take him quite from the body then cut off the belly
piece round close to the lower end of the breast: lace her down with
your knife clean through the breast on each side your thumbs bredth for
the bone in the middle of the breast; then take off the pinion of each
side, and the flesh which you first lac’t with your knife, raise it up
clear from the bone, and take it from the carcase with the pinion; then
cut up the bone which lieth before in the breast (which is commonly
call’d the merry thought) the skin and the flesh being upon it; then cut
from the brest-bone, another slice of flesh clean thorow, &amp; take it
clean from the bone, turn your carcase, and cut it asunder the back-bone
above the loin-bones: then take the rump-end of the back-bone, and lay
it in a fair dish with the skinny-side upwards, lay at the fore-end of
that the merry-thought with the skin side upward, and before that the
apron of the goose; then lay <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘you’">your</ins> pinions on each side contrary, set your legs on
each side contrary behind them, that the bone end of the legs may stand
up cross in the middle of the dish, &amp; the wing pinions on the
outside of them; put under the wing pinions on each side the long slices
of flesh which you cut from the breast bone, and let the ends meet under
the leg bones, let the other ends lie cut in <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘the the’">the</ins> dish betwixt the leg and the
pinion; then pour your sauce into the dish under your meat, throw on
salt, and set it on the table.</p>


<h5>To cut up a Turkey or Bustard.</h5>

<p>Raise up the leg very fair, and open the joynt with the point of your
knife, but take not off the leg; then lace down the breast with your
knife on both sides, &amp; open the breast pinion with the knife, but
take not the pinion off; then raise up the merry-thought betwixt the
breast bone, and the top of the merry-thought, lace down the
<span class = "folionum added">B3v</span>
<!-- png019 -->
flesh on both sides of the breast-bone, and raise up the flesh called
the brawn, turn it outward upon both sides, but break it not, nor cut it
not off; then cut off the wing pinion at the joynt next to the body, and
stick on each side the pinion in the place where ye turned out the
brawn, but cut off the sharp end of the Pinion, take the middle piece,
and that will just fit the place.</p>

<p>You may cut up a capon or pheasant the same way, but of your capon
cut not off the pinion, but in the place where you put the pinion of the
turkey, you must put the gizard of your capon on each side half.</p>


<h5>Dismember that Hern.</h5>

<p>Take off both the legs, and lace it down to the breast with your
knife on both sides, raise up the flesh, and take it clean off with the
pinion; then stick the head in the breast, set the pinion on the
contrary side of the carcase, and the leg on the other side, so that the
bones ends may meet cross over the carcase, and the other wings cross
over upon the top of the carcase.</p>


<h5>Unbrace that Mallard.</h5>

<p>Raise up the pinion and the leg, but take them not off, raise the
merry-thought from the breast, and lace it down on each side of the
breast with your knife, bending to and fro like ways.</p>


<h5>Unlace that Coney.</h5>

<p>Turn the back downwards, &amp; cut the belly flaps clean off from the
kidney, but take heed you cut not the kidney nor the flesh, then put in
the point of your knife between the kidneys, and loosen the flesh from
each side the bone then turn up the back of the rabbit, and cut it cross
between the wings, <!-- between the what?? --> and lace it down close by
the bone with your knife on both sides, then open the flesh of the
rabbit from the bone, with the point of your knife against the kidney,
and pull the leg open softly
<span class = "folionum">B4</span>
<!-- png020 -->
with your hand, but pluck it not off, then thrust in your knife betwixt
the ribs and the kidney, slit it out, and lay the legs close
together.</p>


<h5>Sauce that Capon.</h5>

<p>Lift up the right leg and wing, and so array forth, and lay him in
the platter as he should fly, and so serve him. Know that capons or
chickens be arrayed after one sauce; the chickens shall be sauced with
green sauce or veriuyce.</p>

<h4><a name = "pages" id = "pages">Page Numbering</a></h4>

<p>The printed book combined two systems of page numbering. Throughout
the book, the first four recto (odd, right-hand) pages of each 16-page
signature are labeled as A, A2, A3... These are shown in the right
margin. The left margin shows continuous page numbers, beginning with
signature&nbsp;C (p.&nbsp;1) and continuing through the end of the
recipes (p.&nbsp;461). In signature&nbsp;T, all page numbers were offset
by&nbsp;4 (261-276 for 257-272). The printed number is shown in
(parentheses) followed by the corrected number in <i>italics</i>. Where
there are no page numbers, folio numbers added by the transcriber are
shown in [brackets].</p>

<h4><a name = "spelling" id = "spelling">Spelling</a></h4>

<p>Many compound words occur in up to three forms: with hyphen; as two
separate words; and as a single unhyphenated word. Hyphens at line
break were retained unless the word was consistently hyphenless
elsewhere. Missing spaces between words were supplied when
unambiguous.</p>

<p><b>beatten</b>; <b>Dear</b> (for Deer); <b>galon</b>; <b>oatmel</b>;
<b>somtimes</b></p>
<p class = "inset">
These spellings are rare but each occurs at least once.</p>

<p><b>Boyled</b></p>
<p class = "inset">
The spelling with “y” occurs <i>only</i> in the header for Section I.
Both “boil’d” and “boiled” are used in the body text.</p>

<p><b>lay a lay of ...</b></p>
<p class = "inset">
The word “layer” also occurs, but “lay” is more common.</p>

<p><b>Rabit</b></p>
<p class = "inset">
Note that the word is consistently spelled with one “b” <i>except</i> in
the Index.</p>

<p><b>Snite</b></p>
<p class = "inset">
Probably a variant of “Snipe”, but in some books it is understood as a
different bird.</p>

<p><b>roast, toast</b></p>
<p class = "inset">
Both words can be applied to meats.</p>

<p><b>give it a walm</b></p>
<p class = "inset">
The word “walm” is always used in this construction. It appears to mean
“bring to a boil”. Some occurrences of “warm” may be errors for
“walm”.</p>

<h4>Catchwords</h4>

<p>In several places, text at the beginning of a page was corrected from
the catchword on the previous page:</p>

<p><a name = "noteA" id = "noteA" href = "#tagA">A.</a> <i>You must
break a goose contrary to the former way. Take a goose being
roasted...</i></p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
