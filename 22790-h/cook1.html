The Capon being fine and tender boild take it up, and put it in other

earthen pan or large pipkin, put your capon to it, with two or three

every pound of fruit, a&nbsp;pound and two ounces of sugar, and a grain
of musk; your plum, pippin and peach will have three quarters of an hour

as you can; your grapes and gooseberries must boil half an hour
something fast and they will be the fuller. Note also, that to all your

water, and when they are scalding hot put the fruits first into one of
them and when that grows cold put them in the other, changing them till
