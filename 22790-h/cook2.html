To make a Bisque of Carps.</a></h5>

<p>Take twelve handsome male carps, and one larger than the rest, take

take out their tongues, and take the fish from the bones, then take
twelve large oysters and three or four yolks of hard eggs minc’d
together, season it with cloves, mace, and salt, make thereof a stiff
searse, add thereto the yolks of four or five eggs to bind, and fashion
it into balls or rolls as you please, lay them into a deep dish or
earthen pan, and put thereto twenty or thirty great oysters, two or
three anchoves, the milts &amp; tongues of the twelve carps, half a
pound of fresh butter, the liquor of the oysters, the juyce of a lemon
or two, a&nbsp;little white wine, some of the corbolion wherein the
great carp is boil’d, &amp; a&nbsp;whole onion, so set them a stewing on
a soft fire, and make a soop therewith. For the great carp you must
scald, draw him, and lay him for half an hour with other carps heads in
a deep pan, with as much white wine vinegar as will cover and serve to
boil him &amp; the other heads in, then put therein pepper, whole mace,
a&nbsp;race of ginger, slic’t nutmeg, salt, sweet herbs, an onion or two
slic’t, &amp; a&nbsp;lemon; when you have boiled the carps pour the
liquor with the spices into the
<span class = "pagenum">304</span>
<!-- png333 -->
kettle where you boil him, when it boils put in the carp, and let it not
boil too fast for breaking, after the carp hath boil’d a while put in
the heads, and being boil’d, take off the liquor and let the carps and
the heads keep warm in the kettle till you go to dish them. When you
dress the bisk take a large silver dish, set it on the fire, lay therein
slices of French bread, and steep it with a ladle full of the corbolion,
then take up the great carp and lay him in the midst of the dish, range
the twelve heads about the carp, then lay the fearse of the carp, lay
that into the oysters, milts, and tongues, and pour on the liquor
wherein the fearse was boil’d, wring in the juyce of a lemon and two
oranges, and serve it very hot to the table.</p>

of spinage: sometimes in place of sippets use fritters of arms, somtimes
horse-raddish, and rub the dish with a clove or two of garlick.</p>
